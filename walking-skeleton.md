#### Some decisions on the design of tcgbuddy, both for learning about the structure off the app and for future reference. ####
For now there are 4 parts to tcgbuddy
    - Frontend (sveltekit)
    - Backend (undecided but either Node or C#) currently Rocket (rust)
    - Update/Calculate scripts. Currently GO but looking at python for ease of use
    - MongoDB database
